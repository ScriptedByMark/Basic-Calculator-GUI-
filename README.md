Basic Calculator in C++ (GUI)


Basic Calculator in C++ (GUI) is a Calculator that can be used to perform all the basic arithmetical operations viz. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The calculator has a three dimensional shape, and so do all of its buttons. In other words, it looks like a real world, three-dimensional object rather than a two dimensional shape rendered in a program.

Features :


Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
